They are so very kind, beautiful, pretty and most of all the best bestfriend ever. I dont care if sometimes they make my mood bad,the important is that, most of the time they are always there at by my side willing to lean in their shoulder if I had a problem.And also i dont care if they will make me cry, if they backbite me and etc. Because not all of the time we can encounter a perfect friend because nobodys perfect right? Even me, I am not a perfect person, and a bestfriend of them.But the most important is we respect each other that is the most important for me. And I Love Them so much...</p>
